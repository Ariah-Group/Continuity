<p class="mesgNormal"><span class="mesgBold">Notes to users
of this demo version:</span></p>

<ul class="mesg">
	<li>Once you create a plan, access to that plan is permitted only
	to people whom you later name on the plan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Add/Remove
	Users&rdquo; screen.</li>

	<li>Feel free to create a plan and give access to others &ndash; but
	expect that the plans listed below, created by others, will typically
	not be accessible to you because the creator has not named you.</li>

	<li>Please expect to see &ldquo;junk&rdquo; data in the list
	below. This demo version is open to the public.</li>
