<p class="mesgNormal"><span class="mesgBold">Notes to users
of this demo version:</span></p>

<ul class="mesg">
	<li>Before the Kuali Ready tool is placed in service on a campus,
	the campus administrator of the tool extensively customizes the tool.
	He/she creates the contents of various drop-down lists, creates certain
	on-screen text, decides whether to use certain optional screens, and
	other things. This demo version displays the customization that is in
	use at the University of California, Berkeley. So if you see language
	or lists that appear to belong to a campus other than yours, you are
	probably looking at one of the customizable elements.</li>
	
	<li>The Administrator&rsquo;s Screens are not displayed in this demo
	version.</li>
</ul>
