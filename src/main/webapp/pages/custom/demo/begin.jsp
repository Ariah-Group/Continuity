<p class="mesg"><span class="mesgBold">Please Note:</span> This is the demonstration version of the Kuali Ready
continuity planning tool. It is open to the public, and we encourage you
to &ldquo;try it out&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="mesg">This tool is available for annual subscription. The Kuali
Foundation invites each subscribing institution to place its own name &amp; 
graphic logo on the tool (in place of the Kuali Ready name &amp; logo).
These are installed for you by the Foundation, creating a tool that
displays your campus branding on each page.</p>
