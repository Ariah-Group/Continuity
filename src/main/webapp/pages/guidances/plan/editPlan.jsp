<ul>
<li>This on-line Planning Tool is quite flexible - it works for 
    <ul>
    <li class="indent">academic units </li>
    <li class="indent">research units</li>
    <li class="indent">patient care units</li>
    <li class="indent">public service units</li>
    <li class="indent">support units of any type.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>An academic department would typically use this Planning Tool to create a single continuity plan.  Research units, centers and institutes would do the same.  Departments that share administrative staff (sometimes called clustered departments) would typically create a single plan encompassing all departments in the cluster.

<li>If your unit is large and complex, it may be better to create separate plans for your major subunits, rather than a single plan for the entire organization.  <a href="./contactUs">Contact us</a> for advice.</li>

<li>The "Acronym" question allows us to use some of the abbreviated names that are in common use. Don't be concerned if this question does not apply to your unit.</li>
