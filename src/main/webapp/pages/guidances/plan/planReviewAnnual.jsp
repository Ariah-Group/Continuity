<li><strong>Leadership Review</strong>. The single most important factor in departmental readiness is engagement by the head of the unit.  If your leader has not directly participated in your plan&#39;s Annual Review, we recommend that he or she be asked for input. </li>
<li><strong>Future Updates</strong>.  Your plan will always be fully accessible for changes via this on-line tool.
</li>
<li><strong>Communicate Your Plan</strong>.  The Acrobat version of your plan is available on the <a href="printMenu">Print Menu</a>. Distribute your plan document to your leaders/managers, and communicate the essentials of your plan to all of your faculty and staff.</li>
<li><strong>Carry Out Your Action Items</strong>.  Do them as you are able. They are the key to your unit&#39;s readiness.</li>
</ul>
