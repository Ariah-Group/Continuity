<ul>

<li>A stitch in time saves nine. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. And <strong> Action Items are the most important things in a continuity plan.</strong></li>
<li>Action Items are things that could be done now (or anytime before disaster strikes) to make your unit more prepared.</li>

<li>The typical Action Item begins with a verb and can be stated in one sentence.</li>

<li>Action Items are ideas, not commitments to act. Please think outside the box and don't feel constrained by resources. </li>

<li>Some of your Action Items may be beyond the scope of your unit to perform.  That's OK, we can deliver your ideas to the proper people!</li>

<li>This list of action items is repeated in your <a href="./printMenu">printable continuity plan</a>.</li>
