<ul>
<li>Here you can alter the name attached to this plan. Do so, for example, if your unit gets renamed, if you prefer a different variant of your unit's name, or for any other reason.</li>

<li><strong>Important: </strong> Changing your unit's name on this screen does NOT create a second (copied) plan under a different name. There remains only one plan, and its name (the name of your unit) is whatever you choose.</li>

</ul>
