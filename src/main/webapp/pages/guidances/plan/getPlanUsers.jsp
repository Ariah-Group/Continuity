<strong>Who Can Access Your Plan? </strong>
<ul>
	<li>Access to your department's continuity plan is restricted to those persons specifically authorized for your plan.</li>
	<li><strong>GATEKEEPERS.</strong>  Within this group of authorized users, one (or several) of them  have &ldquo;Gatekeeper&rdquo; status.  Gatekeepers control the membership of the group.</li>  
	<li>This is the screen on which Gatekeepers add or remove group members.  The fact that you are seeing this screen means you are a Gatekeeper.</li>  
	<li>The creator of the plan is automatically a Gatekeeper.</li>
	<li>Any Gatekeeper can designate another Gatekeeper &ndash; or remove another Gatekeeper.</li>
	<li>Plan users who are NOT Gatekeepers cannot access this screen.</li>
	<li>Once granted, a person's authorization (as regular user or as Gatekeeper) remains valid until removed or changed via this screen.</li>
	<li><strong>FULL ACCESS vs. VIEW-ONLY ACCESS.</strong>  Users with view-only access cannot edit the plan.</li>
	<li><strong>SECURITY.</strong>  A plan may contain information that is not meant for wide access.  In addition, a confidential document may occasionally be uploaded into a plan.  Your role as Gatekeeper is to ensure that access to the plan is given only to those who should have it.</li>
</ul>
