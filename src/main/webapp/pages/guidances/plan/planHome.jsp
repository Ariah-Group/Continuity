<li>Some units designate a group of staff to create the continuity plan.  Other units designate one or two individuals, who may gather information, if needed, by interviewing other staff.  In very small units, the manager may create the plan alone.  Whichever route is chosen,  this planning  tool will serve well as your vehicle.</li>
<li>Interview Forms are available to structure your interviews and record information.  See the <a href="./printMenu">Printing Menu</a>.   </li>
<li>Continuity planning using this web tool is intended to be thought-provoking but not time-consuming. We advise that you set a target of <strong>two months or less</strong> to complete your plan. Most of the time spent should be in discussion; actual "typing time" is less than you might expect (provided you accept our advice to give brief answers!)</li>
<li>This on-line tool is best viewed at a screen  resolution of 1024 x 768 or higher. If any pages appear wider than your screen,  consider increasing your resolution.  In Windows, you will find this option by clicking Start -> Control Panel -> Display -> Settings.</li>
