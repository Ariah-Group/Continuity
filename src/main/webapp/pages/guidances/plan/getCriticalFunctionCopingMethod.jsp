<ul>
<li>Accept this challenge: <strong>We will continue (or rapidly restart) our teaching, research, patient care, and necessary support functions, no matter what the conditions.</strong></li>
<li>Be brief! If details are needed, create a separate document and upload it on the <a href="./getCriticalFunctionDocuments?criticalFunction.id=<s:property value='criticalFunction.id'/>">Documents</a> screen.</li>
<li>If your suggestions require pre-disaster preparations, that's fine. Later you will be asked to identify such "Action Items."</li>
<li>When planning for the staffing of your unit during and after a crisis-event, remember that many factors influence a person's ability to come to work -- availability of child care, schools, elder care, pet care, transportation, and many other factors when our lives get disrupted. Would it be possible to compensate with temporary help? Where will you get them? Will they need training?
</li>
<li>The <a href="./getKeyResourcesWorkFromHomeStaffs">Work from Home screen</a> will ask who among your faculty and staff can do computing from home. Consider whether your unit also has tasks that can be done at home WITHOUT a computer. </li>

</ul>
