<ul class="guidance">
	<li>The lists in Step 5 collect information that you may need close at hand in the early 
	days after a disaster: 
	<ul class="indent">
		<li class="indent">when crucial staff may not be reachable</li>
		<li class="indent">when offices may not be accessible</li>
		<li class="indent">when computer networks may  be down</li>
		<li class="indent">when leaders/managers may have to handle issues outside their
		normal spheres</li>
	</ul>
	
	</li>
	<li>Avoid the temptation to list all your staff. The folks to list here are those who can help
	"sort things out" and plan the next steps.</li>
	<li>This <em>Restarting Berkeley</em> tool will not prompt you for emergency contact information for your staff. This information (home address, home phone number, and other items) will be made available in restricted HRMS reports. Expect details in early 2007. </li>
</ul>
