<ul>

<li>On this screen we answer the questions "who produces what we need" and "who needs what we produce".</li>
<li>The dependencies we speak of here are primarily <strong>departments</strong>, although occasionally it is quite appropriate to name a <strong>process</strong> (e.g. instruction) or a <strong>group of people</strong> (e.g. students).</li>
<li>Please do not name <strong>IT systems</strong> as either upstream or downstream dependencies. IT systems are treated separately.
