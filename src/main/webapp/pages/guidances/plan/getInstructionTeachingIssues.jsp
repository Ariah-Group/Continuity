	<li>Many courses have special formats or require special
	resources. This screen asks you to identify teaching situations that
	may pose particular challenges following a disaster, so we can explore
	possible solutions.</li>

	<li>The availability of alternative strategies for special format
	courses may vary. In some cases, viable alternatives may not exist. If
	you do have specific solutions that would enable instruction to
	continue, please say so!</li>
