<ul>
<li>Every unit is asked to keep its own list of home contact information for faculty &amp; staff. Your list should be 
<ul>
<li class="indent">in a format of your choosing </li>
<li class="indent">held by enough people to be useful </li>
<li class="indent">treated as confidential </li>
<li class="indent">kept securely at home and at work  </li>
<li class="indent">updated at least twice a year. </li>
<li class="indent">See <a href="./toKnowItems">Things to Know</a> for what to include on this list.  </li></ul>
</li>
<li>Resist the temptation to list all your staff under "Key People".  The staff you should list here are the ones you would call upon first in time of crisis - who have the experience, skills, or authority to help "sort things out" and plan the next steps.</li>
<li>A <strong>leadership successor</strong> is a person who would be an appropriate substitute if the head of the unit is absent. In most cases, this will not be an officially-designated position. </li>
<li>A <strong>formal delegation of authority</strong> is an assignment of authority &amp; responsibility to perform specified acts on behalf of the organization: e.g., to sign specified types of contracts. This assignment is almost always granted via a written document. </li>
