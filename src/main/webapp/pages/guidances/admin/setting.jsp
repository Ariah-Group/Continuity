<ul>

<li>The Teams, Skills, and Staffing Requirements screens may be displayed or hidden, at your discretion.  Some Local Administrators will find these useful, others not.
</li>
<li>The Examples of Critical Functions screen is reported by users to be very helpful.  The checkbox here allows you to hide this screen UNTIL you have accumulated data to display on it (see <a href="criticalFunctions">Setup Examples of Critical Functions</a>).</li>
<li>The &ldquo;Replace Step 4&rdquo; option allows you to display either a general screen addressing faculty issues OR a set of 6 screens that address instructional issues in considerable depth.</li>
<li>Full Moderation is selected by default.</li>
<li>The Detail Screens checkbox  lets you decide whether functions to which the user assigns the 4th (lowest) level of criticality should be exempted from any further questions.  Default is &ldquo;unchecked&rdquo; (exempt from further questions).  Leaving this unchecked keeps the focus on functions in the top 3 categories, and  shortens the time needed by the user to complete the plan.</li>
