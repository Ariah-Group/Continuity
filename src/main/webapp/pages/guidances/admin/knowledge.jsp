<li>The text that the user sees on the <strong>Things to Know as You Plan</strong> screen is authored by you, the Administrator.  You will enter that text here.</li>


<li>The intent is to present to the users any type of information that will be useful to them as they prepare their organizations to continue functioning in the face of adverse events.  Departmental personnel within large organizations often lack information about the larger context &ndash; </li>
<ul class="indent">
	<li>the plans in place at the campus level for immediate response</li>
	
 	<li>how the &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo; departments (IT, HR, purchasing, payroll, Registrar, many others) will continue to provide essential services</li>
	<li>what advice or resources are available now to departments to help them in their own readiness efforts</li>
    <li>and much more.</li>
  </ul>
 <li>This is your opportunity to provide some of that.</li>
<li>The entry-box provides many formatting options.  As you do your entries, check the outcome on the  <strong>Things to Know as You Plan</strong> screen.</li>
<li>As you type inside the entry-box, [Enter] creates a new paragraph preceded by a space. [Shift-Enter] creates a new paragraph with no intervening space.</li>
