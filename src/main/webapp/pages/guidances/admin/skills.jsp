<li>Multi-campus institutions may find value in using the same list for all locations (or at least the same core list with locally-added items) to enable institution-wide reporting.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;order&rdquo; number controls the sequence of the items on the drop-down list displayed to the user, regardless of any other sorting that you do on this screen.</li>
<li>If the optional <strong>Skills</strong> screen is not used at your location (campus), there is no need to provide the information requested on this screen.</li>
