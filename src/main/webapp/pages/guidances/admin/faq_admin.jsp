<ul>

<li>The text that the user sees on the <strong>Frequently-Asked Questions</strong> screen is authored by you, the Administrator.  You will enter that text here.</li>

<li>The format is question and answer:  the questions will be listed for the user at the top of the screen, each question serving as a link to the answer below.</li>

<li>Like the <strong>Things to Know as You Plan</strong> screen, the content is up to you.  You may want to establish a rationale to distinguish the information on these 2 screens.  A suggestion is to focus the <strong>FAQ</strong> screen on questions about the tool and the departmental planning process, while using the <strong>Things to Know</strong>  screen for larger, contextual information about the campus, other depts., readiness approaches, etc.</li>

<li>The entry-box provides many formatting options.  As you do your entries, check the outcome on the  <strong>FAQ</strong> screen.</li>

<li>As you type inside the entry-box, [Enter] creates a new paragraph preceded by a space. [Shift-Enter] creates a new paragraph with no intervening space.</li>

</ul>
