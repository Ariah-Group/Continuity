<ul>  
<li>The question "Identify Your Unit's <cfoutput>#Request.Institution.CriticalUpper#</cfoutput> Functions" is the most crucial question in this planning tool.
This screen enables you (as Local Administrator) to select good examples of <cfoutput>#Request.Institution.CriticalLower#</cfoutput> function lists from existing plans that will then be displayed to users to aid their thought process. 
</li>
<li>It may take time to accumulate some good examples; until you reach that point, you should uncheck the option called 
<b>Show Examples of <cfoutput>#Request.Institution.CriticalUpper#</cfoutput> Functions</b> on the <a href="myInstitution.cfm">System Settings</a> page. 
Doing so will hide this feature from users until you have provided the examples.</li>

</ul>
