<ul>

<li>This screen is accessible only to System Administrators (SAs).</li>
<li>Only SAs can insert, update, or delete institutions & locations.</li>
<li>The fundamental unit for organizing data is the <strong>location</strong> (campus).  The name of the location appears in numerous places, so be careful to use the correct name.</li>
<li>The name of the Institution, though a required field, is not displayed anywhere in this Planning Tool.  The only function of "Institution" is to support the role of Institution Administrator who will be able to access data & perform Admin functions for all locations that are related to his institution.</li>
<li>For a single campus that is not part of a larger institution (a System), simply enter the Location name into the Institution field (i.e., both Location & Institution will be named the same).</li>
