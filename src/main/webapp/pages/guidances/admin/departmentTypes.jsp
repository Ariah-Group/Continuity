<ul>
<li>Presenting  users with a &ldquo;type of department&rdquo; selection creates an important  categorization for later reporting of data.</li>
<li>Multi-campus institutions may find value in using the same list for all locations (or at least the same core list with locally-added items) to enable institution-wide reporting.</li>
<li>Users will be allowed to select an unlimited number of items from the list; hence your items do not need to be mutually-exclusive.  </li>
<li>Try to create a list whose items will have clarity for the user.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;order&rdquo; number controls the sequence of the items on the drop-down list displayed to the user, regardless of any other sorting that you do on this screen.</li>
</ul>
