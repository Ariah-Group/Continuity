<ul>

<li>The text items that you place on this page will be unique to your campus, medical center, or national lab - but you may find it useful to look at the items used at other UC locations.</li>

<li>You may either type your text directly into the entry-box, or copy-paste from Word.</li>

<li>When typing in the entry-box, [Enter] creates a new paragraph preceded by a space. [Shift-Enter] creates a new paragraph with no intervening space.</li>

<li>If you copy-paste from Word, you will be presented with a dialog box to clean up the Word formatting. Paste your Word text into that dialog box, check both "Ignore Font Face Definitions" and "Remove Styles Definitions", then hit OK. Your Word text will be displayed in UC Ready's default font and will match any manually-entered text.</li>

<li>Use the buttons in the entry-box to control formatting and to add hyperlinks.</li>
