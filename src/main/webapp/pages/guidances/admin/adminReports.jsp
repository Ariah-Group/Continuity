<li>After you select a report, you will be offered some options to refine that report. Hence these 18 items produce a powerful array of reports.</li>

To correct this, locate the long string in the table, then go to the  <a href="../plan/getPlans"> Choose A Plan</a> screen, open the plan that contains the string, locate the string, manually "break" the string by inserting a space, then Save.
