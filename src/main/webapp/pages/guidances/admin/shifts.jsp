<li>The optional <strong>Staffing Requirements</strong> screen has been used more at medical centers than at campuses.  While there are departments on campuses for which that screen would be appropriate, displaying it carries the risk of stalling and confusing other users, so we recommend this factor be considered when deciding to whether to use the <strong>Staffing Requirements</strong> screen.</li>
<li>If the optional <strong>Staffing Requirements</strong> screen is not used at your location (campus), there is no need to provide the information requested on this screen.</li>
