<!--- Guidance for Administrator MyInstitution.cfm screen --->

This screen is available only to Local Administrators.
<ul>
<li>Use the "Access" selection to "turn on" or "turn off" the UC Ready tool for <strong>ALL</strong> of your users (except Local Administrators). You will want to turn it "off" to your users anytime you are using these "Administrator Control Screens" to alter the configuration of the tool. 
</li>
<li>The 4 check-boxes under "Screen Options" determine the display for <strong>ALL</strong> users at your location (campus, med center, etc.). The first 3 boxes show-or-hide entire screens. The 4th will show-or-hide the "See Examples from Other Departments" button on the "Step 2: <cfoutput>#Request.Institution.CriticalUpper#</cfoutput> Functions" screen. These choices are reversible - change them at any time.
</li>

<li>The optional <strong>Skills</strong> screen collects information on skills that may be <strong>needed</strong> by the department in times of crisis.  Consideration is being given to including a <strong>skills available</strong> screen in the next version of the UC Ready tool.</li>
</ul>
