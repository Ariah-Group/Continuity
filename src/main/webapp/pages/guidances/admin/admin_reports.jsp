<!--- Guidance for all admin report screens --->

<ul>

<li>Each report is downloadable as an MS Word document.  Within the document, data is in an MS Word table.  This allows you great freedom to modify both content and formatting.</li> 
<li>If the exact report you desire is not offered, consider using a larger report (more inclusive), then delete undesired rows or columns.</li>
<li>Most reports allow you to specify the sort before creating the report.  MS Word tables can also be sorted.  Hence you can sort again after deleting rows or columns.</li>
<li>All MS Word reports are in portrait orientation.  Change manually to landscape if needed (File&mdash;  Page Setup).</li>
<li>Screen width will &ldquo;squeeze&rdquo; some reports.  Download the MS Word version and change to landscape.</li>
<li>Hint &ndash; typing an acronym in the &ldquo;Specify Plan&rdquo; box will call up all plans using that acronym.</li>
