<!--- Guidance for Instructional Departments screen --->

<ul>

<li>On this screen you recreate your campus&acute;s official list of instructional departments.  In most cases that is simply the list of departments presented in the Course Catalog.  The reason for doing this (rather laborious) task is that Step 4 discusses specific courses by name; and courses are identified by department.  For various reasons, the name of the department that appears as the title of the continuity plan in this Planning Tool may not align perfectly with the departmental names in the Course Catalog that identify courses.</li>

<li>If <strong>Step 4: Faculty Preparedness</strong> is selected for use in preference to <strong>Step 4: Instruction</strong>, there is no need to provide the information requested on this screen.</li>
