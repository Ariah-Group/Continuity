<!--- Guidance for Administrator Annual Review screen --->


<ul>

<li>Continued readiness requires that we periodically review, update, and perhaps &ldquo;exercise&rdquo; our continuity plan.  Tracking of action items will be part of this.  This Planning Tool provides a way to record the occurrence of Annual Reviews but leaves the nature & process of the Annual Reviews up to you.  The <strong>Annual Review of Your Plan</strong> screen gives you a setting to specify that process.</li>

<li>Here you will create the content of that screen.</li>

<li>The entry-box provides many formatting options.  As you do your entries, check the outcome on the <strong>Annual Review of Your Plan</strong> screen.</li>

<li>As you type inside the entry-box, [Enter] creates a new paragraph preceded by a space. [Shift-Enter] creates a new paragraph with no intervening space.</li>


</ul>
