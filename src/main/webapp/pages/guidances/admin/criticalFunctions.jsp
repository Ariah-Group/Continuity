<ul>

<li>
The question &ldquo;Identify Your Unit's Critical Functions&rdquo; is the most crucial question in this Planning Tool. This screen enables you (as Local Administrator) to select good examples of critical function lists from existing plans that will then be displayed to other users to aid their thought process.
</li>
<li>
It may take time to accumulate some good examples; until you reach that point, you should uncheck the option called &ldquo;Show Examples of Critical Functions&rdquo; on the <a href="./setting">Setup System Parameters</a> screen. Doing so will hide this feature from users until you have provided the examples.

</li>
<li>Checking or unchecking that option controls the appearance of a link labeled &ldquo;See real examples from other departments&rdquo; on the <strong>Step 2: Critical Functions</strong>  screen.  This link is the only way for a user to access the examples; hence hiding the link hides the examples.</li>
<li><strong>Before</strong> clicking View User-Screen, click Save Selections.</li>
