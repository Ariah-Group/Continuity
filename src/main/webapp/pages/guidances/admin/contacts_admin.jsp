<li>Throughout this Planning Tool, whenever the on-screen text invites the user to &ldquo;contact us&rdquo;, the hyperlink delivers the user to the <strong>Contacts</strong> screen.  Here you will create the content of that screen.</li>

<li>The entry-box provides many formatting options.  As you do your entries, check the outcome on the <strong>Contacts</strong> screen.</li>

<li>As you type inside the entry-box, [Enter] creates a new paragraph preceded by a space. [Shift-Enter] creates a new paragraph with no intervening space.</li>
