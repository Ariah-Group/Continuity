<ul>
<li>The questions on the six <strong>Step 4: Instruction</strong> screens are the product of a faculty study at the University of California, Berkeley.  In 2007-2008 a broad-based committee of Berkeley faculty was asked to investigate what can be done by instructors and departments to make teaching the curriculum more resilient to disruption by unplanned events.  The questions in <strong>Step 4: Instruction</strong> are adapted from their published recommendations.</li>


<li>The selection of which version of Step 4 to use at your location (campus) is made on the <a href="./setting">Setup System Parameters screen</a>. <strong>Step 4: Faculty Preparedness</strong> is a simple approach that will be appropriate at any campus.  <strong>Step 4: Instruction</strong> is a more in-depth treatment of the instructional process that you may want to discuss with your campus&acute;s academic officer prior to using.</li>
<li>If <strong>Step 4: Faculty Preparedness </strong> is selected for use, there is no need to provide the information requested on this screen.
