<li>The Planner's Log that is included in the UC Ready tool is a flexible way to keep track of your continuity planning program.  Its use is optional.  Should you decide to use it, this present screen will enable you to categorize your entries in the Log.  You can create whatever categories that you desire, and there is no limit to the number of categories.</li>
