	    	<p>Users of this tool are asked to identify which buildings their department occupies.&nbsp; To do so, they are offered a drop-down list of buildings. This occurs on the <b>Step 1:&nbsp; Department Identification</b> screen.<p>
	      	<p>Using the entry forms below, you will construct that list.</p>
  			<ul class="numberlist">
				<li>If necessary, obtain your institution's list of buildings from whoever owns it.</li>
				<li>Decide which buildings should be included on the list you present to users of this tool.  Suggestion: eliminate toolsheds, bus shelters and other structures that do not house people and whose loss would have little impact on the mission.</li>
				<li>Identify the buildings whose common names differ from their official names.  In the entry-forms below, &ldquo;common name&rdquo; is the item that will be displayed to users in the drop-down list.  Make sure that the common name is indeed the name that will be recognized by staff & faculty.</li>
				<li>The &ldquo;Identifier&rdquo; field is provided for institutions that attach a unique number or other key field to each building.</li>
			</ul>					
			<p>To modify an existing item, first highlight that row on the grid then use the entry-forms at bottom to modify.</p>
