<li>Throughout the UC Ready tool, whenever the on-screen text invites the user to "contact us", the hyperlink delivers the user to the <strong>Contacts</strong> page.</li>

<li>Use this present screen to input the content of that <strong>Contacts </strong> page.</li>

<li>You may either type your text directly into the entry-box, or copy-paste from Word.</li>

<li>When typing in the entry-box, [Enter] creates a new paragraph preceded by a space. [Shift-Enter] creates a new paragraph with no intervening space.</li>

<li>If you copy-paste from Word, you will be presented with a dialog box to clean up the Word formatting. Paste your Word text into that dialog box, check both "Ignore Font Face Definitions" and "Remove Styles Definitions", then hit OK. Your Word text will be displayed in UC Ready's default font and will match any manually-entered text.</li>

<li>Use the buttons in the entry-box to control formatting and to add hyperlinks.</li>
