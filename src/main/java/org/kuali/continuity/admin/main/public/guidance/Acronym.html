<li>Acronyms are used purely as a grouping device to organize alphabetically-sorted lists of plans.</li>
<li>Identify acronyms for large units (schools, colleges, divisions) which are likely to have multiple plans.  For example, a hospital will have many departments, each with a plan, so it may make sense to identify an acronym for the hospital.  Likewise, a college of liberal arts will have multiple departments;  same conclusion.</li>
<li>Do not bother with acronyms for units that will have a single plan, and no subunit plans.  For example, the Dept of Mathematics will likely have a single plan, and the name of the plan will be "Dept of Mathematics", or simply "Mathematics".  Nothing is gained by naming the plan "MATH - Dept of Mathematics".</li>
<li>Where possible, choose acronyms that are in common use.  If an acronym would be useful but none exists, feel free to make one up.</li>
