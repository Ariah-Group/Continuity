<ul>
<li>When the user is asked to identify the building(s) occupied by his department, he will be presented with a list showing only the <strong>common names</strong> of the buildings at your location.   You will supply those common names using the present screen.</li>
<li>A "common name" is whatever name the building is most widely known by.  Sometimes a building may have more than one common name;  you are allowed only one common name, so choose the one you think is most recognizable.  Alternatively, you may offer both common names in this fashion:  "Dodge Hall (aka Alumni House)"</li>
<li>Your location's master building list (from UCOP's database) will contain buildings that are not significant for our purpose (toolsheds? bus-stop shelters? pumphouses? -- you decide). Do not pull these buildings from the master building list. You can change your mind at any later time.</li>
<li>If an existing building does not appear on the master building list, use the data-entry boxes to make it appear on your list. 
</li>
<li>As buildings get built, demolished, re-named, leased, or leases get terminated, update this list manually. You may want to contact your local facilities record-keeper every year or so to learn the changes.</li> 

<li>CAAN No. (Capital Asset Acctg No.) is a building's unique identifier. CAAN Name is the building's name as it appears in the UCOP database.</li>
<li>If Ownership is listed as "Special Status", contact your facilities record-keeper for details.
