<li>The reason for presenting users with a "type of department" selection is to create an important category for database searches and reporting of data.</li>
<li>To further aid <strong>Systemwide</strong> searchability, we will have a number of core items on this list that will be used by all UC locations.  These will be supplied at initial startup.  </li>
<li>You may add other items that will appear at your location only.</li>
<li>Users will be allowed to select an unlimited number of items from the list;  hence your additional items will not deteriorate the quality of the information.  Please be careful, when adding local items, to avoid overlapping categories that might confuse the user.</li>
